# BEP-TCG
Mathematica notebook created to analyze Best Experienced Payoff (BEP) dynamics in 3-strategy Tacit Coordination Games (TCG)

This software was used to create several figures in the paper titled ["Stability of Strict Equilibria in Best Experienced Payoff Dynamics: Simple Formulas and Applications"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2022.105553), published in 2022 in the <i>Journal of Economic Theory</i> by [Segismundo S. Izquierdo](http://www.segis.izqui.org) & [Luis R. Izquierdo](http://www.luis.izqui.org). [doi: 10.1016/j.jet.2022.105553](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jet.2022.105553)
