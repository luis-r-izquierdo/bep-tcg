Mathematica notebook created to analyze Best Experienced Payoff (BEP) dynamics in 3-strategy Tacit Coordination Games (TCG)

This software was used to create several figures in the paper titled "Stability of Strict Equilibria in Best Experienced Payoff Dynamics: Simple Formulas and Applications", by [Segismundo S. Izquierdo](http://www.segis.izqui.org) & [Luis R. Izquierdo](http://www.luis.izqui.org). 

This work is dedicated to the memory of our dear master and friend Bill Sandholm.
